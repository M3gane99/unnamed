# Unnamed
This  platformer (made with Pygame - a python library) is a cute little project I put together. While it's not super challenging, it's designed to be a fun and relaxing experience. Don't expect it to be a marathon though, as it's fairly short (only one level). But hey, if you're up for a quick and enjoyable game, I'd be really happy if you gave it a try! I made it using some free assets since I'm not exactly an artist, but I hope it still brings you joy.
